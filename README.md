# Adaptive Golf Glove â€“ ArthroGrip

ArthroGrip is an adaptive golf glove designed to support one-armed golfers and individuals with upper body disabilities. The product is engineered to reduce the risk of arthritis and promote accessibility in sports through ergonomic design and adjustable support.

## Project Overview

- Designed to prevent joint injuries and enhance grip for adaptive athletes
- Focused on unilateral overuse and its link to osteoarthritis in repetitive sports
- Developed with adjustability in mind using elastic materials for user-defined support

## Objectives

- Provide functional wrist support for one-armed and upper-body-limited golfers
- Reduce mechanical stress to minimize long-term cartilage wear
- Encourage inclusivity in recreational and competitive adaptive sports

## Key Features

- Elastic-based adjustability to control tightness and grip strength
- Ergonomic glove structure to support wrist alignment and comfort
- Potential for broader use beyond golf (e.g., general support for repetitive tasks)

## Design Considerations

- Prioritized ethical material sourcing and affordability for accessibility
- Conducted user interviews and integrated feedback into design improvements
- Emphasized safe and inclusive design tailored to a range of physical abilities
